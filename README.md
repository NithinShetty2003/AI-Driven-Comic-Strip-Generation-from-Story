# AI-Driven-Comic-Strip-Generation-from-Story

How to Run This Project
Follow these steps to run the AI-driven comic strip generation project using Google Colab:
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) in your browser.
2. Sign in with your Google account if you're not already logged in.
3. Click on "File" -> "New notebook" to create a new Colab notebook.
4. Go to "Runtime" -> "Change runtime type".
    In the popup window, set the Hardware accelerator to T4 GPU (or any available GPU).
    Click "Save".
5. Open the [GitHub repository](your-github-link-here) and copy the code cells into your Colab notebook in order.
6. Create a new Groq API by Signing in to Groq Website and Place it in the Code.
7. Run all the cells one by one or choose "Runtime" -> "Run all".
8. When prompted, input your story and select a manga style as instructed.
9. The AI will process your input and automatically generate a comic strip based on your story.


Tips & Notes
1. Recommended Browser: Use Google Chrome or Firefox for best compatibility with Google Colab.
2. Colab Timeout: Google Colab may disconnect if idle for too long. Stay active or occasionally interact with the notebook to avoid losing progress.
3. Input Formatting: Write clear and coherent stories in English for best comic generation results. Avoid slang, shorthand, or overly complex sentences.
4. Style Selection: Choose a manga style that fits your story theme (e.g., fantasy, manga, cartoon). This can enhance the visual coherence of the strip.
5. GPU Quotas: If Colab doesn't provide a GPU (e.g., T4), wait a few hours or try again later. Free users have limited GPU access.
6. Saving Your Work: Download the generated comic strip after creation, as Colab sessions reset and data may be lost.
